JS;
?>

        <div id="time-down-counter-2"></div>
        <?= Yii2TimerCountDown::widget([
            'countDownIdSelector' => 'time-down-counter-2',
            'countDownDate' => strtotime('+1 minutes') * 1000,// You most * 1000 to convert time to milisecond
            'countDownResSperator' => ':',

            'templateStyle' => 0,
            'getTemplateResult' => 0,
            'addServerTime' => false,
            'callBack' => $callBackScript
        ]) ?>
```
1) countDownIdSelector: This option give you apilty to change default timer wrapper, its usfall if you have more than one timer in the same page, default selctor value is 'time-down-counter', and this selector must be an ID.

2) countDownDate: This option will accept count down date in millisecond, if you keep it empty the default value will be current time so that the count down over message will be print.
Note: you need to set time in millisecond like this **strtotime("+1 day") * 1000;** **OR strtotime("2018-11-10 15:47:25") * 1000**.

3) countDownResSperator: This option give you apilty to change time Sperator, default sperator is **```<span class="timeDownSperator">:</span>```**.

7) contDownOver: This option give you apilty to update message for count down over (when timer is finshed).

8) getTemplateResult: This option give you apilty to stop count down timer, the default value is **0** and thats mean timer work, **1** is mean stop timer and display timer result, **2** is mean stop timer and display html timer result.
These option give you abilty to design / styling timer on browser dirctly, since the timer is work depednace of Interval function, and second option is usfall when you need to get result to set default value in html, since js need some time to start timing.

example if we use **getTemplateResult: 2** :
```
<div id="time-down-counter">30<span class="timeDownSperator">:</span>23<span class="timeDownSperator">:</span>59<span class="timeDownSperator">:</span>58</div>
```

Note: If you set template 1 or 2 the addSpanForResult & addSpanForEachNum will be change to true!.

10) callBack: this option used to set script will be render after timer end. (Callback function)
